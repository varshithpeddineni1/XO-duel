# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and any AI agent) working in this repo. The binding
rules live in [`rules.md`](./rules.md); the feature spec is in
[`.specify/xo-duel-spec.md`](./.specify/xo-duel-spec.md). Read both before
non-trivial work (AGENT-1).

## What this is

XO Duel: a full-stack online Tic Tac Toe game. Node + Express + Socket.io API,
Postgres, React + Vite SPA, hosted on a Hetzner VPS (backend) and Vercel
(frontend) behind Cloudflare (DNS + SSL) and Nginx. Guest play works for every
mode, including online multiplayer — no login wall anywhere (API-7). Accounts
are an optional upgrade for history, friends, and leaderboards.

## Build, test, run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev --workspace server     # API + Socket.io  http://localhost:3000
npm run dev --workspace client     # SPA              http://localhost:5173
npm run migrate                    # apply DB migrations
npm test                           # Vitest unit + coverage (gate >=80%, no DB)
npm run test:integration --workspace server  # supertest + socket.io-client vs Postgres (needs DATABASE_URL)
npm run lint && npm run typecheck  # ESLint + tsc
npm run test:e2e                   # Playwright (full stack: API + client preview)
docker-compose up                  # full local stack
```

## Working agreement

- **Plan first.** For any non-trivial change, read the spec and present a
  plan before editing (AGENT-1, AGENT-2).
- **Tests before or with code** (TEST-1). Keep coverage >= 80% (DOD-1).
- **Verify, don't assert.** Show command output or a test result; never claim
  success without evidence (DOD-2). UI work needs a Playwright screenshot
  before it is "done" (AGENT-3, DOD-3).
- **Thin handlers, pure logic.** Business logic lives in
  `server/src/services`; win/draw detection and the minimax AI stay pure in
  `server/src/domain`, with no I/O (ARC-1, ARC-2).
- **Server is authoritative.** No client-side determination of turn order,
  move legality, or game-over state — ever (ARC-5). This applies even though
  guests can create and join games without an account.
- **Real-time means sockets, not polling.** Online-game moves, presence, and
  results are pushed via Socket.io as they happen (API-8).
- **Invite codes are single-use and high-entropy** (API-5, API-6) — never
  reusable, never guessable.
- **Schema only via migrations** in `server/migrations` (DB-2).
- **No secrets in code or logs** (SEC-1, OBS-1). Config comes from env
  (CODE-3).
- **Conventional Commits**, branch from an issue, squash-merge via PR
  (GIT-1, GIT-3, GIT-6, GIT-7).

## Current state

> **Keep this section current.** Whenever a pull request completes a
> milestone from the spec's suggested build order (or meaningfully changes
> what's built), rewrite this section in that same PR (DOD-4, AGENT-4) —
> concretely, not vaguely: name which endpoints/socket events exist, which
> are still stubbed, and which Playwright test is expected to still fail, if
> any. Do not leave this paragraph describing a stale state.

**Phase 1 (foundations) landed.** npm workspaces (`server`, `client`, `e2e`), shared root
ESLint/Prettier, `.env.example`, the initial Postgres migration (`players`, `friendships`,
`games`, `game_players`, `moves`, `events`, `session`), pure/unit-tested domain logic
(`gameLogic.ts`, `minimax.ts`), and design tokens (`client/src/styles/tokens.css`, OKLCH,
`[data-theme]`). `ci.yml` + `pr-review.yml` wired up.

**Phase 2 (local play + AI opponent, end to end) landed.** Real REST API, server-
authoritative (ARC-5): `POST /api/games` (`mode: 'local'` or `mode: 'ai'` +
`aiDifficulty`), `GET /api/games/:id`, `POST /api/games/:id/moves` (body `{ cell, mark }` —
rejects wrong-turn/occupied/out-of-range moves and any client-submitted `mark: 'O'` in
ai-mode; computes the AI's reply server-side in the same request via Phase 1's
`getAiMove`). Board state is derived by replaying `moves` (`server/src/domain/board.ts`) —
no `board` column exists. Finalization (outcome per `game_players`, `events` row) happens
inline in the moves handler, not via a separate `/complete` endpoint. Validated with zod
(`server/src/schemas/gameSchemas.ts`), rate-limited on creation (API-10), documented via
an OpenAPI doc served at `/api/docs` in non-production (API-1). All 11 unit tests for the
new schema/board logic plus 34 total server unit tests pass at ~97% coverage; a
Postgres-backed integration suite (`games.integration.test.ts`, run via
`npm run test:integration`, new `integration` CI job) covers the endpoints end to end,
including a full "impossible" playthrough that never loses.

Frontend: `App.tsx` is now a real screen state machine (home → difficulty → board →
result), wired to the API. New components: `ModeButton`, `DifficultyCard`, `Board`/`Cell`
(each cell has an accessible `aria-label` now), `ScoreTile`, `ResultBanner`,
`RematchButton`, `ThemeToggle`. `theme.ts` moved to `theme/index.ts` to match CLAUDE.md's
declared layout. Two new Playwright specs (`local-game.spec.ts`, `ai-game.spec.ts`) drive
the real flows through client+server+Postgres — the `e2e` CI job now also runs the built
API server (Playwright `webServer` array) against the same Postgres service container as
`integration`. I could not run these two new e2e specs or the integration suite locally
(no Postgres/Docker available in this environment) — CI is the real verification for both,
same as Phase 1's migration check.

**Phase 3 (real-time online multiplayer) landed.** `server/src/sockets/` (Socket.io,
attached via a new `createServer()` in `index.ts` that wraps `createApp()` in a plain
`http.Server` — `createApp()` itself is unchanged, still used by REST-only supertest):
`join_game` (by invite code, binds a socket to X or O, or reconnects a disconnected mark
via a token), `make_move` (same `checkWinner`/board-replay rules as REST, keyed by
socket→mark), `game_over` (`reason: 'completed' | 'forfeit'`), `player_disconnected` /
`player_reconnected` (30s grace period, `DISCONNECT_GRACE_PERIOD_MS`), and the mutual-accept
rematch handshake (`request_rematch` / `rematch_requested` / `accept_rematch` /
`decline_rematch` / `rematch_accepted`). `POST /api/games` now also accepts
`mode: 'online'` (creates a `waiting` game, one seat filled, real invite code — API-6); new
`GET /api/games/invite/:code` for pre-join validation. Room state (socket↔mark bindings,
reconnect tokens, the grace-period timer) is deliberately **in server memory, not the
database** — see `docs/adr/0002-online-room-state.md` for why and its one real limitation
(a mid-game server restart loses reconnect capability for games in flight). A
Postgres-backed Socket.io integration suite
(`server/src/sockets/gameSocket.integration.test.ts`) covers join, a full game, illegal/
out-of-turn move rejection, disconnect→forfeit, reconnect, and both rematch outcomes.

Frontend: Home's Online Multiplayer card is wired up; `OnlineWaiting.tsx` shows the room
code and a **real, scannable QR code** (`qrcode` package — the mockup's own QR was
decorative/fake); `useOnlineGame.ts` owns the Socket.io connection and persists a reconnect
token in `sessionStorage`. `GameScreen`/`Result` (Phase 2) gained an
opponent-disconnected banner and mutual-accept rematch UI respectively, reused as-is
otherwise. New Playwright spec `online-game.spec.ts` drives **two browser contexts**
through create → join → full game → mutual rematch, and a separate disconnect→forfeit
flow. As with Phase 2, I could not run the new integration suite or e2e spec locally (no
Postgres/Docker in this environment) — CI is the real evidence.

**Phase 4 (accounts) landed.** Every visitor now gets a session (`express-session` +
`connect-pg-simple`, against the `session` table migrated back in Phase 1 for exactly this):
`POST /api/session` (creates or resumes a guest `players` row, no login required — API-7),
`GET /api/me` (current player, `null` if no session yet). Registering is an in-place
upgrade, not a new row: `POST /api/auth/register` (`username`/`password`, argon2 — SEC-1)
sets `username`/`password_hash`/`is_registered` on the *same* row a guest already had,
so anything already attributed to it is retained automatically. `POST /api/auth/login`
(regenerates the session id first, to prevent session fixation) and `POST /api/auth/logout`
round it out; login/register are both rate-limited tighter than game creation
(`server/src/routes/auth.ts` — API-10). `POST /api/games` now attributes `game_players.
player_id` to the human seat for local/AI modes via `req.session.playerId` — **online
games still don't**, since that needs sharing the session middleware with the Socket.io
layer, which is a real gap this phase left open (not one of its named deliverables, and
not needed to prove guest→registered retention, which is provable via local/AI play alone).
`server/src/services/playerService.ts` also computes aggregate win/loss/draw stats
(`GROUP BY outcome` over `game_players`) — there is no per-game history endpoint or table
yet, that's Phase 5's `HistoryRow`/`GET /api/games/history` job.

Frontend: `AppHeader` (extracted from Home's old inline header, now shared with the new
`Account` screen), `BottomNav` (Home + Account tabs only — History/Leaderboard tabs are
added in Phase 5 once those destinations exist), `Login` (username/password/confirm,
toggles between login and register), `Account` (guest-vs-registered status, W/D/L stat
tiles once registered). `App.tsx` silently calls `POST /api/session` + `GET /api/me` once
on mount to hydrate the current player. New Playwright spec `account.spec.ts`: guest plays
a local game to a win, registers mid-session, confirms the *same* win count is retained
(not reset to 0), logs out, logs back in with the same credentials. As with every phase so
far, I could not run the new integration suite or e2e spec locally (no Postgres/Docker in
this environment) — CI is the real evidence.

**Phase 5 (friends, leaderboards, history, admin dashboard) landed.** Fixed a real gap
Phase 4 had left open: online games never attributed `game_players.player_id` because a
Socket.io connection didn't share the Express session. `server/src/index.ts`'s
`createServer()` now creates one `express-session` instance and hands it to *both*
`createApp()` and `io.engine.use(sessionMiddleware)`, so `socket.request.session` (cast
through `express.Request` — `@types/express-session` augments `Express.Request`, not
`http.IncomingMessage`, which is what `socket.request` is actually typed as) sees the same
identity a REST call from that browser tab would. `createOnlineGame`/`joinOnlineGame`/
`createRematchGame` all take the resulting player id now — without this, the leaderboard
below would have stayed permanently empty for every online game.

- **History**: `GET /api/games/history` (mode-filterable), registered-only by construction
  (`requireRegisteredPlayer` — there's no stable id to query a guest's history by, so
  API-9's "no persistent history for a guest" isn't a special case, just a natural
  consequence). `client/src/pages/History.tsx` — filter pills, win/loss/draw result badges.
- **Leaderboards**: `GET /api/leaderboard/global`, `GET /api/friends/leaderboard` — derived
  on read (DB-7) from `game_players`, scoped to `mode = 'online'` games where *neither*
  seat is null (API-9: excludes local/AI by the mode filter, excludes any game with a guest
  on either side by construction). **Ranking formula (was an open spec decision): win
  rate, minimum 5 qualifying games** — below that a player just doesn't appear yet.
  `client/src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx` — Friends/Global tabs, rank coloring, "isMe"
  highlighting.
- **Friends**: `server/src/services/friendService.ts` — search, request/accept/decline,
  and a permanent personal invite code (`players.invite_code`, generated at registration,
  `FR-` prefix so it can't be confused with a game's `XO-` code) for one-step instant-accept
  invites. The `friendships` table's unique constraint only covers the *ordered*
  (requester, addressee) pair, so `sendFriendRequest` checks both orderings itself — a
  mutual request (both sides ask each other) auto-accepts instead of creating a duplicate
  row. No dedicated Friends screen existed in the mockup to adapt — `client/src/pages/
  Friends.tsx` (search, pending requests, invite-link sharing) was designed from scratch,
  reachable from the Leaderboard's Friends tab, not a new BottomNav destination.
- **Admin dashboard**: real auth (`server/src/routes/admin.ts`, `req.session.isAdmin`,
  `requireAdmin` middleware) — replaces the mockup's hardcoded client-side check entirely,
  reused none of it (SEC-2, SEC-10 — read-only, no mutation routes exist).
  `GET /api/admin/stats` reads `events` for the genuinely historical metrics (games over
  the last 7 days, outcome distribution — OBS-3) but reads `players`/`games` directly for
  the two current-state snapshots (active players, games in progress) rather than trying
  to reconstruct live state from an event log. `GET /api/admin/players` lists everyone,
  guest and registered. Frontend `AdminLogin`/`AdminDashboard` also have no mockup
  reference for the stats layout or the players table (the mockup's tiles didn't match
  OBS-3's actual required metrics) — built from the spec/rule text directly, linked from a
  small entry point on the Account screen, not a BottomNav tab.
- `BottomNav` gained its final two tabs, **History** and **Ranks** (the label the mockup
  actually uses for the leaderboard tab) — this is the point where Phase 3/4's "only Home +
  Account for now, the rest wait for their destinations to exist" comment resolves itself.
- Tests: unit (win-rate math via the schema/service layer, `FR-` invite code format);
  integration suites for history filtering, leaderboard scoping (confirms local/AI and
  guest-side games never appear, confirms the min-games threshold), the full friend
  lifecycle (search → request → accept/decline, mutual-request auto-accept, invite-link
  accept), and admin auth (every `/api/admin/*` route 401s without a session, 200s with
  one). `leaderboard.integration.test.ts` and the new e2e `leaderboard.spec.ts` both play
  actual Socket.io games (5 of them, to clear the ranking threshold) rather than mocking
  game data, so they also exercise the session-sharing fix above end to end. New
  `admin.spec.ts`. As with every phase so far, I could not run the integration suites or
  e2e specs locally (no Postgres/Docker in this environment) — CI is the real evidence.

**Phase 6 (deploy) landed — tooling only, live deployment is pending on real
infrastructure.** Per the user's explicit decision, the backend deploy mechanism (the
spec's §11 open decision) is a **manual pull + PM2-reload script**, not GitHub Actions SSH
automation — deliberately, to avoid putting VPS SSH keys in GitHub secrets. This phase is
entirely config/scripts/docs; no application code changed.

- `deploy/setup-vps.sh` — one-time Ubuntu 24.04 bootstrap (Node 20.x via NodeSource,
  PostgreSQL 18 via the PGDG apt repo since Ubuntu 24.04's own repos don't carry it, Nginx,
  PM2, `ufw` firewall allowing only 22/80/443, the `xo_duel` Postgres role/database, repo
  clone to `/opt/xo-duel`).
- `deploy/nginx.conf` — reverse-proxy site config; TLS via a Cloudflare Origin Certificate
  ("Full (strict)" mode — stricter than Cloudflare's "Flexible" mode, satisfies SEC-7's "no
  plaintext to the origin" more literally); WebSocket upgrade headers (without them,
  Socket.io's connections fail to upgrade — API-8).
- `deploy/ecosystem.config.cjs` — PM2 process file; holds no secrets, `cwd` is derived from
  the file's own location (`__dirname`) so it resolves correctly regardless of where
  `deploy.sh` happens to invoke `pm2` from.
- `deploy/deploy.sh` — the actual redeploy script a human runs by hand after a merge: pull,
  `npm ci`, build, migrate, `pm2 startOrReload --update-env`, then checks `/api/health`
  and fails loudly if it doesn't respond.
- `docs/runbook.md` — the spec's named deliverable: one-time setup (VPS → Cloudflare →
  origin cert → Nginx → `.env` → PM2 → Vercel, in order, since later steps depend on
  earlier ones), routine deploy, restart, logs, rollback (with the migration-rollback
  caveat — `deploy.sh`'s `npm run migrate` only ever applies new migrations forward,
  checking out an older commit doesn't undo one a bad release already applied), and
  troubleshooting.

**What's still genuinely pending, and can't be done from here:** provisioning the actual
Hetzner VPS, registering a domain, creating the Cloudflare/Vercel projects, and the spec's
own Phase 6 verify line — a live domain reachable off-network, a full online game played
between two real devices through the deployed stack, health check green. None of that is
possible without real accounts and money the user has to provide; the runbook is written
so that once they exist, standing it up is following numbered steps, not figuring things
out from scratch.

**Still stubbed / not started (out of v1 scope on purpose):** admin moderation
(suspend/ban — explicitly a future phase per SEC-10), nickname-editing UI for guests,
everything in the spec's §12 "Future phases" list (matchmaking queue, ELO rating,
spectator mode/chat, PWA, tournaments). Every phase from the suggested build order is now
built; what's left is standing up the infrastructure this phase's tooling targets.
